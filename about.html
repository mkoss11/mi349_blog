        <img src="images/headshot.jpg" alt="Author Headshot" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;">
        <p>Hi there! I'm a senior at Michigan State University, majoring in Information Science and minoring in Information Technology. My passion for technology has driven me to explore a wide range of IT-related fields, from web design and systems analysis to troubleshooting hardware and software issues. For the past year and a half, I’ve been working as an IT intern at Tenneco, where I assist with managing computer systems, resolving technical issues, and supporting multiple sites across Michigan. This hands-on experience has helped me broaden my skill set and refine my interest in IT as a career.

            When I’m not working or studying, I like to stay active, especially by playing soccer. I’m part of an intramural soccer team at MSU, which has been a great way to balance the demands of school with something I love. Playing soccer keeps me focused and is a fun way to unwind after a day spent working on tech projects or assignments.
            
            I also have three younger triplet sisters who are freshmen in college, so life at home is always interesting. My dog, Puck, brings even more energy to the house, keeping things lively!</p>
        <h3>Some of my favorite things:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Apple Ecosystem</li>
            <li>The Marvel Cinematic Universe</li>
            <li>Music. I have some sort of music playing at almost all times.</li>
        </ul>
