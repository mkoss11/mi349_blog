            <p>This is my favorite keyboard as of recently, and it's become a staple in my setup. The low-profile Gateron red switches make all the difference in the way the keyboard sounds and types. They provide a smooth and satisfying keystroke without being overly loud, making it perfect for both work and gaming. I love the tactile feedback and how responsive each keypress feels, which has greatly improved my typing speed and overall experience.

                One of the standout features is the 75% layout. It's compact enough that it doesn’t take up too much space on my desk, yet it still retains all the essential keys I need. This makes it a great balance between functionality and minimalism, especially for someone like me who doesn't want a cluttered workspace.
                
                Additionally, the ability to pair this keyboard to three different devices simultaneously has been a game-changer. With just the click of a button, I can seamlessly switch between my main PC, work laptop, and even my Xbox. This versatility makes it incredibly convenient, whether I’m working during the day or gaming at night. Overall, this keyboard has exceeded my expectations and has quickly become an essential part of my daily routine.</p>

            <h2>TurtleBeach Stealth 500 Headset</h2>
            <p><time datetime="2024-10-13">October 13, 2024</time> by Michael Koss</p>
            <img src="images/Stealth 500 Headset.jpeg" alt="Stealth 500 Headset image" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;">
            <p>I picked up the Stealth 500 Headset from Turtle Beach for gaming, and initially, I was impressed. The low-latency 2.4GHz wireless connection paired with Bluetooth 5.2 allowed me to seamlessly switch between my Xbox and other devices using the QuickSwitch button. The headset boasts an impressive battery life of up to 40 hours, which has been great for long gaming sessions. I also really enjoy the lightweight design, memory foam cushions, and the clear sound from the amplified 40mm drivers.

                However, I’ve encountered some issues lately. Voice chat on Xbox has been inconsistent, sometimes cutting out when I’m in the middle of a game, which is frustrating. Additionally, while the headset works great with my Xbox, I’ve found that it doesn’t seem to be compatible with my PC, limiting its versatility.
                
                On the bright side, I do appreciate the Swarm II app that comes with it, allowing me to fine-tune audio settings with the 10-band EQ. The Superhuman Hearing sound setting is also a nice feature, giving me an edge in competitive games. Despite the pros, the connectivity issues have made me reconsider my choice.</p>
